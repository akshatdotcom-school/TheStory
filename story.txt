Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a
yelp and a bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless,
and it took Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale and said,
"It sounds like a wolf - but yet there are no wolves here now."
"No?" I said, questioning him. "Isn't it long since the wolves were
so near the city?"
"Long, long," he answered, "in the spring and summer; but with
the snow the wolves have been here not so long."
Whilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark
clouds drifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away,
and a breath of cold wind seemed to drift over us. It was only a
breath, however, and more of a warning than a fact, for the sun
came out brightly again.
Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and said, "The
storm of snow, he comes before long time." Then he looked at his
watch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly - for the
horses were still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their
heads - he climbed to his box as though the time had come for
proceeding on our journey.
